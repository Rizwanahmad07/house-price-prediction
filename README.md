 Tom Mitchell provides explained: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.“
Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
1) Supervised Learning: - In supervised learning, we are given a data set and 	already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that 	there is a relationship between the input and the output. Supervised 	learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" 	problems.
2) In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous 	output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some 	continuous function.
3) In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete 	output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete 	categories.

Unsupervised Learning :- Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems 	with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive 	structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the 	variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on 	relationships among the variables in the data. With unsupervised learning 	there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
# How it works ?
COLLECTING DATA: FIRST STEP WAS TO COLLECT DATA WE COLLECTED DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES & MERGED THEM TOGETHER TO FORM OUR TRAINING DATA SET.
THEN WE TRAINED THE MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNIG ALGORITHM WHICH IN THIS CASE IS MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION.
BASED ON THE GENERATED GRAPHS WE PREDICT THE COST OF THE HOUSE
